Using /Users/paulomcnally/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.0
aulomcnally/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.0/bin' is not at first place,
         usually this is caused by shell initialization files - check them for 'PATH=...' entries,
         it might also help to re-add RVM to your dotfiles: 'rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles',
         to fix temporarily in this shell session run: 'rvm use ruby-2.2.0'.
